## ✨ About the Game  
**"Potion or Poison?"** is a **narrative-driven puzzle game** that blends potion crafting with deduction mechanics. Inspired by *Papers, Please* and *Little Alchemy*, this game challenges players to analyse textual and visual clues to identify hidden threats while crafting potions for the kingdom's court.  

As an apprentice potion-maker in the **Order of Royal Sorcerers**, you must prove your arcane intuition by preparing potions for customers while uncovering enemy insurgents attempting to **assassinate the King** during his coronation! With only **three in-game days**, you must decide—who to help and who to...*eliminate* ☠️.
